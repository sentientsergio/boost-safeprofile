# Self-Test Results - Phase 0

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Tool Version:** 0.0.1
**Test Command:** `build/boost-safeprofile --sarif self-test.sarif src/`

---

## Summary

✅ **Self-Conformance: PASS**

The Boost.SafeProfile tool successfully analyzed its own codebase and found **zero actual violations** of the core-safety profile.

---

## Test Results

### Files Analyzed
- **Total source files:** 12
- **Modules covered:**
  - `src/cli/` - Command-line argument parsing
  - `src/intake/` - Repository and source file discovery
  - `src/profile/` - Profile and rule loading
  - `src/analysis/` - Detector and analysis engine
  - `src/emit/` - SARIF output generation
  - `src/main.cpp` - Main pipeline

### Findings

**Total findings:** 4
**Actual violations:** 0
**False positives:** 4 (expected for Phase 0 keyword-based detection)

#### False Positive Analysis

All 4 findings are false positives due to Phase 0's simple keyword matching:

1. **src/profile/loader.cpp:25** - Comment text: `"naked new detection"`
2. **src/profile/loader.cpp:28** - String literal: `"Naked new expression"`
3. **src/profile/loader.cpp:33** - String literal: `" new "` (the search pattern itself)
4. **src/profile/rule.hpp:26** - Comment text: `"Naked new expression"`

**Verification:** Manual grep for actual `new` expressions (excluding comments, strings, and variable names) returned zero results.

## Conformance Verification

### Safe C++ Practices Used

✅ **No naked new/delete** - All allocations use RAII containers (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::optional`)
✅ **No owning raw pointers** - Smart pointers or containers everywhere
✅ **RAII everywhere** - `std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream` auto-close
✅ **Bounds-checked access** - Using `std::vector` with safe access patterns
✅ **No unsafe casts** - Only safe `static_cast` for size conversions
✅ **No pointer arithmetic** - Using iterators and standard algorithms

### Code Review Highlights

**Memory Management:**
- `std::vector` for dynamic collections
- `std::string` for string storage
- `std::optional` for nullable values
- `boost::filesystem::path` for paths

**Resource Management:**
- `std::ifstream`/`std::ofstream` with RAII
- No manual `fopen`/`fclose`
- Exception-safe design throughout

**Safe APIs:**
- `std::getline()` for file reading
- `.find()` for string search (no pointer arithmetic)
- `.push_back()` for vector growth
- Boost.JSON for structured data

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 0)

The false positives are **expected and acceptable** for Phase 0:

1. **Keyword-based detection** - Simple substring matching will match patterns in comments, strings, and identifiers
2. **No context awareness** - Cannot distinguish between comments and actual code
3. **Substring matching** - Pattern " new " matches any occurrence, including in longer words

These limitations will be addressed in Phase 1+ with:
- AST-based analysis using Clang LibTooling
- Context-aware detection (skip comments/strings)
- Semantic analysis for accurate violation detection

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 0 Self-Test: ✅ PASS**

Boost.SafeProfile's codebase conforms to the Safe C++ subset it enforces. All findings are false positives inherent to the Phase 0 keyword-based detection approach. The tool successfully demonstrates the complete end-to-end pipeline:

**Intake → Profile Loading → Analysis → SARIF Output**

The tool is ready for v0.0.1 release as a working MVP vertical slice.
